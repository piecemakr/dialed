    answer: "No, you will not get high or experience intense hallucinations from DIALED. The active ingredient, muscimol, works primarily on the GABA receptors in your brain, promoting relaxation and calm without the typical psychedelic effects associated with substances like psilocybin. Instead of feeling intoxicated, you will experience a calming, clear-headed sensation that can help reduce stress and anxiety."

Many users report that DIALED helps them to shift their perspective, showing them ways to improve their well-being, reduce self-limiting thoughts, and adopt a more positive outlook, all while maintaining a calming effect."
